# C.A. Area Maps

This is an interactive global map project that displays every recognized (and physical) C.A. Area. Online Area(s) and other non-physical entities are not displayed.

To edit the GeoJSON, we recommend using an interactive tool such as [https://vector.rocks/](https://vector.rocks/)

This is an ongoing project from the WSCIT Committee in collaboration with S&B, along with various other contributors.
