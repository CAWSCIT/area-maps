# C.A. Area Maps

[https://cawscit.github.io/area-maps/](https://cawscit.github.io/area-maps/)

This is an interactive global map project that displays every recognized (and physical) C.A. Area. Online Area(s) and other non-physical entities are not displayed.

To edit the GeoJSON, we recommend using an interactive tool such as [https://vector.rocks/](https://vector.rocks/)

This is an ongoing project from the WSCIT Committee in collaboration with S&B, along with various other contributors.

**Note**: The borders in this project _are not_ perfect. They are designed to be "close enough". If your location is represented by the wrong area in this interactive map, please contact WSCSB or WSCIT with details so it can be adjusted.
